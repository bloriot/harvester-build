# Harvester Image Builder

A toolkit for automating the creation of custom [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io/) disk images.

This repository provides scripts and a Makefile to:
1.  **Download** official Harvester artifacts (ISO, Kernel, Initrd).
2.  **Patch** the ISO to inject custom hooks (e.g., for OpenStack Ironic ConfigDrive support).
3.  **Build** bootable raw or QCOW2 disk images for direct VM deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the required tools installed.

* **SLES/openSUSE:**
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install curl xorriso squashfs qemu-img qemu-x86 ovmf make
    ```

* **Debian/Ubuntu:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install curl xorriso squashfs-tools qemu-utils qemu-system-x86 ovmf make
    ```
* **RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install curl xorriso squashfs-tools qemu-img qemu-system-x86 ovmf make
    ```

### 2. Build a Standard Image
To download the latest Harvester ISO and convert it to a bootable QCOW2 image:

```bash
make
```

### 3. Build an Ironic-Compatible Image

To inject the **Ironic ConfigDrive Hook** (required for OpenStack Ironic deployments using `config-2` labels):

```bash
make PATCH_IRONIC=true
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Variables

You can customize the build by passing variables to `make`.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VERSION` | `v1.7.0` | The Harvester version to download and build. |
| `PATCH_IRONIC` | `false` | Set to `true` to inject the Ironic compatibility hook. |
| `FORMAT` | `qcow2` | Output disk format. Options: `qcow2`, `raw-zst`. |
| `ARCH` | `amd64` | Architecture to build for. |
| `BOOT_MODE` | `efi` | Boot firmware type (`efi` or `bios`). |

**Example:** Build a specific version for EFI boot:

```bash
make VERSION=v1.7.1 BOOT_MODE=efi
```

### Script Details

* **`download-harvester-artefacts.sh`**: Auto-detects the latest version (or accepts a specific tag) and downloads all required files to a local directory.
* **`build-raw-image.sh`**: Uses QEMU/KVM to boot the Harvester installer in a headless VM and installs the OS onto a virtual disk file. It supports exporting to `qcow2` or compressed raw (`raw-zst`).
* **`ironic-patch/...`**: Unpacks the Harvester ISO `rootfs.squashfs`, injects a custom hook into `/system/oem`, and repacks the ISO. This hook allows Harvester to read configuration from OpenStack Ironic `config-2` drives, which are normally ignored by the OS.

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all generated images, staging areas, and downloaded artifacts:

```bash
make clean
```

If you only want to remove the generated images but **keep the downloaded ISOs** (to avoid re-downloading next time), simply delete the `build-staging-*` directory manually or modify the `clean` target in the Makefile.

```bash
rm -rf build-staging-*
```
